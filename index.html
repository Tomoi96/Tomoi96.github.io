        <p>At the begining there was a wish. And a wish wouldn't come to fruition without sacrifice...<br>Anyway, anyhow, hi! I'm Tomislav Lazic, 26 year old learner who is trying (not enough I admit) to learn web development good enough to land a job in this industry.<br>I was born on 3rd December 1996 in Slavonski Brod, Croatia.</p>

          <figcaption>I was born in Slavonski Brod, a small town in Croatia. This is a old picture of my town which I find somehow lovely, even though I wasn't even born at the time.</figcaption>

          <p>My hobbies are reading, writing, playing videogames, and little programing and web design of course. Oh yeah, I play a guittar a bit as well! But, since I give most of my love and affection to reading, and amateur writing here and there, I suppose i should talk about that part of my life first. </p>
